            koth is a boolean value, taking on false if the match is stopwatch and true if the match is koth

            The difference in skill (home - away) is how much more likely one team is to win a given round than the other.
            Its absolute value will take on values between 0 and 6 almost all of the time, virtue of the normal distribution,
            and it should be near impossible to take on values greater than 7.
            Then, we treat:
            - a skill difference of 0 to mean that each team has a 50% chance of winning each round
            - a skill difference of 1 to mean that the home team has a 7/12 (48.33%) chance of winning each round, and
              the away team has a 5/12 chance of winning each round
            - a skill difference of -1 to mean the exact opposite - i.e. the home team has a 5/12 chance, the away team 7/12
            - a skill difference of 2 to mean that the home team has an 8/12 (66.67%) chance of winning each round, and
              the away team has a 4/12 = 1/3 chance of winning each round
            - a skill difference of 3 to mean that the home team has a 9/12...
            - In the general case, a skill difference of "n" to mean that the home team has a (6+n)/12 chance of winning each
              round, where n âˆˆ [-6,6]
            - If n < -6, treat it as if n = -6
            - If n > 6, treat it as if n = 6

            We run the match until we have a winner, i.e. at least one team has won 4 rounds on koth or 2 on stopwatch.
