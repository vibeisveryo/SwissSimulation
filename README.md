# Swiss Simulation

This repository is for a program to simulate Swiss style tournaments (for now, using the Monrad system). I use it to conduct research about the effectiveness of different tournament structures at fairly measuring player/team skill.

This is made for my personal use, and is released to the public insofar as it may be useful, but without any guarantee of fitness of use.
